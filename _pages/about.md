Hi my name is Nikhil and I'm a data scientist. I worked as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.raise.com/" target="_blank">Raise Marketplace</a> , which is an online gift cards selling company, but ever since my job was impacted because of COVID, I decided to take this opportunity to acquire new skills and work on a <a href="https://github.com/NikhilSawal/investment_portfolio" target="_blank">research problem</a>, that I have been thinking of taking for quite some time.

# My Story

My journey in Data Science & Machine Learning was inspired by Google I/O, which is an annual developers conference held in Mountain View, California. Google was announcing all the cool stuff that they were doing, using machine learning. Be it, using voice commands *(Hey Google)* to set up reminders or using face recognition to filter pictures of a specific person, it was like an epiphany moment for me. And then there was Facebook using ML to fight hate speech and misinformation, Jeff Bezos's Amazon using recommendation engine as early as 1999 which pretty much sealed everything.
