This repository has the templates to get started with machine learning algorithms and get a baseline prediction up and ready. The repository currently covers the following:

1. Regression algorithms
2. Classification algorithms
3. Clustering algorithms
4. Data preprocessing
5. Dimensionality reduction
6. Model selection and boosting

Future templates:
1. ARIMA
2. Fast forier transform
