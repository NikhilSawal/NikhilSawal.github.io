# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/NikhilSawal/algorithms)

The idea behind this exercise is to learn how to approach a general coding problem and get well-versed with the different functionalities that python has to offer. I am currently solving problems from LeetCode. By the end of this exercise I wish to accomplish following things:
1. Control Flows
2. Data structures
3. Static programming
4. Error handling
5. Concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
